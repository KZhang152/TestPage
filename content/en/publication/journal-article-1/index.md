abstract: Extensive evidence has demonstrated that analyzing oxygen desaturation patterns during night-time is a powerful tool in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). This paper presents an innovative genetic algorithm, referred to as ERD-GA, designed for diagnosing pediatric OSAHS. It incorporates an elitism retention strategy along with dynamic crossover and mutation probabilities, leading to a substantial improvement in diagnostic efficiency. Through a rigorous analysis of fluctuation patterns in blood oxygen saturation signals (SpO2) and fine-tuning oxygen desaturation screening parameters, the algorithm demonstrates a high degree of proficiency in identifying obstructive apnea–hypopnea events. The validation has been performed on two separate datasets, comprising 36 and 318 pediatric subjects. Notably, it exhibited sensitivity rates of 97.83%, 91.67%, and 84.51% for classifying mild, moderate, and severe OSAHS cases, respectively. The results highlight the noteworthy advancements of the proposed algorithm in both oxygen desaturation detection and apnea–hypopnea detection. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values, measuring at 0.951 and 0.985 for the respective detections, indicate a high level of agreement with the PSG results. Additionally, the model demonstrates a substantial correlation with the gold standard PSG model in terms of the Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient values are 0.969 and 0.927 in the two datasets, respectively. These findings suggest that the proposed methodology signifies an innovative approach to diagnosing pediatric OSAHS and associated conditions.
