abstract: 'The fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is widely used in gene expression data. However, the FCM clustering algorithm often exhibits poor clustering performance on datasets, and similarity measures based on Euclidean distance only consider the issue of local consistency between data points. Feature weighting algorithms are a necessary step to achieve efficient and accurate gene expression data clustering. In this article, a new dissimilarity measure is proposed, along with the introduction of a feature-weighted FCM algorithm incorporating this dissimilarity measure. This algorithm outperforms traditional methods, demonstrating better robustness. By assigning weights to different eigenvalues and using mathematical reasoning and analysis, in order to address the effects of noise and other. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied and studied on a tumor gene expression dataset. Experimental analysis and comparisons confirm that the proposed algorithm exhibits better convergence, robustness, and accuracy, With the proposed algorithm, the accuracy is improved by 0.22.'
